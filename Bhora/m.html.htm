    <p>Maharashtra  is a state in the western peninsular region of India occupying a<br>
	substantial portion of the Deccan Plateau. It is the second-most populous state <br>
	and third-largest state by area in India. Spread over 307,713 km2 (118,809 sq mi),<br>
	it is bordered by the Arabian Sea to the west, the Indian states of Karnataka and Goa <br>
	to the south, Telangana to the southeast and Chhattisgarh to the east, Gujarat and <br>
	Madhya Pradesh to the north, and the Indian union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli <br>

Maharashtra was formed by merging the western and south-western parts of the Bombay State, <br>
Berar and Vidarbha, and the north-western parts of the Hyderabad State and splitting<br>
 Saurashtra (in present-day Gujarat) by the States Reorganisation Act. It has over 112 <br>
 million inhabitants and its capital, Mumbai, has a population around 18 million making<br>
 it the most populous urban area in India. Nagpur hosts the winter session of the state<br>
 legislature.[10] Pune is known as the 'Oxford of the East' due to the presence of several<br>
 well-known educational institutions.[11][12] Nashik is known as the 'Wine Capital of India' <br>
 as it has the largest number of wineries and vineyards in the country.
